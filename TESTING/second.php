   <h1> How technology is influencing the education system.  </h1>
  <img src="art2.jpg" alt="Simply Easy Learning" width="900" height="400">
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <p> Technology is influencing the education system in many ways. Schools are now using computers, robotics, and artificial intelligence to provide a better, more interactive learning experience.

The first way technology is influencing education is through the use of computers in the classroom. This can be seen as early as kindergarten, where children are exposed to basic computer concepts such as mouse skills and typing. As students grow older, they will learn how to use more advanced programs such as Microsoft Word or Photoshop. With computers, teachers can easily access information about their students' progress and assign them work based on their needs.

Another way that technology is influencing education is through robotics and artificial intelligence. Schools around the world are starting to use robots for everything from helping with homework to providing an extra set of hands during class time.

One of the newest innovations in this field comes from Japan, where a robot named Pepper has been designed specifically to interact with children and help them learn social skills like sharing or taking turns playing games together. This type of interaction could lead us into a world where robots are able to replace teachers altogether!</p>
    <br>
    
In addition to making learning easier, technology is also improving education because it can be used by professors to better assess students??? progress. Grades are given more quickly than before so students know their grade right away rather than waiting days or weeks for their grades to come back from the teacher. Professors also have access to a variety of programs that allow them to track how much time each student spends on a particular assignment and follow their progress through the coursework as well as see how long each student spends studying.
